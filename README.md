In a project focused on optimizing data management, I implemented arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues across various scenarios. Arrays were leveraged for direct access and static data storage, while linked lists handled dynamic data with frequent insertions and deletions. Stacks facilitated Last-In-First-Out operations, like managing function calls, while queues managed First-In-First-Out operations, such as task scheduling. Through benchmarking and optimization exploration,the project provided insights into the performance and practical applicability of these fundamental data structures.
